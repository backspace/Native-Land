#Native Land

Native Land (http://native-land.ca/) is a web app with Google Maps API for mapping Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties across Turtle Island (North America).

This app is simply meant to sit on top of Google maps and provide a map of native land. This is starting in British Columbia, Canada, but if I establish a good framework it should work anywhere.

I got the idea for this app while driving along the Sea-to-Sky highway between Vancouver and Squamish in BC. Many of the road signs had the local language place names for rivers, towns, and more, in brackets underneath the English names. I thought "why isn't the English in brackets...?"

This project was created by Victor Temprano and has been around a couple years, expanding along the way. The current incarnation as a React app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
