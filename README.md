# Native Land

Native Land ([http://native-land.ca/][1]) is a web app with Google Maps API for mapping Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties across Turtle Island (North America).

### Data

* Data sources are listed on the [resources page][3]
* Are a vast array of different maps and resources cobbled together and open to revisions
* Stored in geoJSONs in the `coordinates/` directory

### API

For API docs and examples, see [http://native-land.ca/api/index.html][2].

<p>This app is simply meant to sit on top of Google maps and provide a map of native land. This is starting in British Columbia, Canada, but if I establish a good framework it should work anywhere.</p>
<p>I got the idea for this app while driving along the Sea-to-Sky highway between Vancouver and Squamish in BC. Many of the road signs had the local language place names for rivers, towns, and more, in brackets underneath the English names. I thought "why isn't the English in brackets...?"</p>
